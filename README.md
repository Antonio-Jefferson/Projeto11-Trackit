## Features
##### User Registration: 
- Users will be able to register in the application by providing information such as name, email and password. This information will be securely stored in the database.

##### User Login: 
- After registering, users will be able to login to the application using their e-mail and password. This process will ensure proper authentication and authorization to access the unique functionality of each user's account.

##### Habit Tracking: 
- The application will allow users to create a personalized list of habits they want to track. They will be able to add, edit and remove habits from the list, setting daily or weekly goals for each one.

##### Progress Log: 
- Users will be able to log their daily or weekly progress for each habit. The application will keep a history of these records, allowing users to view their performance over time.
